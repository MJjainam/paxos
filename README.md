# paxos
Paxos is a bedrock algorithm in distributed systems. This repo attempts to simulate Paxos in Go.

## Points ensured when writing the code
1. The code must be easy to understand. 
2. Well documented.
3. Highly configurable that allows simulation of failures, adding network delays
4. Metrics and Observability
